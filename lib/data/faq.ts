    title: 'How does Serpent Swap work?',
    content: `
      SerpentSwap is based on Uniswap V3 contracts and uses a liquidity pool model to create a decentralized token exchange. Liquidity providers deposit tokens into a liquidity pool, and traders can swap tokens using the liquidity in the pool. Liquidity providers earn a fee on each trade proportional to their share of the pool.

      SerpentSwap also integrates fractional NFTs into these liquidity pools, allowing keen traders to quickly swap between a tokenized share in various NFT collections while also rewarding long-term HODLers for providing the liquidity for these trades.
